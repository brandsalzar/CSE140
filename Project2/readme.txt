In order to be able to compile your project with the given makefile, you will need to install gtk 2.0 library in your system. (I think the machines in labs have it installed already.)

(UPDATED) To install it on your own computer follow the steps below:

Type "sudo apt-get update" and hit enter in a terminal. Follow the prompt to finish update.

Type "sudo apt-get install gtk2.0" and hit enter. It will take a while to finish installation.

 

If you are using a Windows PC to run your project, you will need to install Xming (an X server for Windows).

Here is the link to the download:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/Links to an external site.

Once you have installed Xming, run the program and type: "export DISPLAY=:0" and hit enter before running your program (./tips).
